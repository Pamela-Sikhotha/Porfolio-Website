            <div>
                <p class="col-sm-12 paras texting">ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded web development education to young, African, women.
                  <br><br>
                 ADA's mission is to empower. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive, mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.

            <div>
                <p class="col-sm-12 paras texting">The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe, where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer.
                 <br><br>
                There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of applicants would make it through.
                <br><br>
                All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability. The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies.

             <div><p class="col-sm-12 paras texting"> Journeys are moments in life that define and reconstruct the myths we create about ourselves and others. One must travel outside the constraints of mindset to discover endless opportunities. On such a journey one can expect moments of planned reflection or unexpected instances of revelation. A journey is every minute of my existence, as I travel through life and try to ascertain my own presence in its cycle.

                An essential journey occurred last year when I was granted an amazing opportunity that changed my life and helped me to tap into the unknown world of software development.
                
                It all began at Harambee when I was offered an opportunity to write an aptitude test, passing that test meant that I was granted an amazing opportunity to attend the Bootcamp then to study at ADA (African Developers Academy ) which is a year-long tuition-free school for African women with no previous professional experience in coding or computer programming. The program aims to diversify the tech industry and empower women in development.

            <div><p class="col-sm-12 paras texts ADA">
                  ADA has impacted me both personally and professionally, from learning how to code to personal development. Learning how to code: When the course started, I didn’t know what to expect. Quickly did I learn that this was more than just about developing but also creativity, design, and seamless user interface for programs/ websites. It was absolutely mind-blowing to witness my transformation from not knowing how to code to developing websites. As the course progressed, we were designated into groups most of the time, I learned that it was more than just about a single individual and her ideas and behaviors. I also learned that it is very important to understand how small groups work. Reflecting upon my personal journey with my groups, I have learnt that working in small groups requires commitment, synergy, communication, listening, conflict resolution, decision making, and problem-solving. This brings me upon my personal journey with my small group and how I have learned to work in such an environment. We were all delegated with an individual role each time and when I was designated team leader for the first time for our group. I felt at the time that this role did not suit me as I am the type of person who is more on the shy side. I tried to serve to the best of my capabilities even though I was relatively unsure of how things were handled and came out a different person through these experiences.
                   <br><br>

                I've learned a lot this past year but to name a few... I’ve learned that it takes creativity, problem-solving, tenacity, and communication skills to be a software developer, so really having a diverse team is incredibly beneficial.
                I have never thought that someone like me who had no previous professional education in computer programming could feel so accepted. I came to ADA with no experience in software development, they basically taught me everything. The fact that ADA could bring us all together under one roof and guide us through the journey to an unknown world, that being software development, to learn, to make the tech sector more diverse and a more accepting place, that alone was incredible.
                 I was not only amazed by how much people cared but how special each and every person at ADA was.
                <br><br>
                Being at ADA was an amazing quest. I can now do a lot of things including developing beautiful websites but I can also communicate more effectively, I think ADA goes beyond just teaching technical skills, it also teaches you important life and social skills. 
                
                The past year feels like the only part of my life where I have truly lived. The massive majority of my most cherished memories and greatest challenges have taken place within the last few months.
                
                 I now have a large pool of people that I can rely on, seek help from and also help mentor as alumni, making sure that I keep the process of paying it forward and showing up. It has absolutely changed my life. I hope to inspire others to achieve their dreams regardless of whether or not they look-the-part. It’s important for people to have role models that look more like them in positions that they aspire to be in. I hope to show aspiring developers that despite the demographic in  STEM fields, they should not be deterred in their ambitions.
                 <br><br>
                 It has not been easy navigating through this journey especially when we have a global COVID-19 pandemic at hand. It has led to a lot of uncertainty about the future we predicted but through it all, I still have and cherish the most valuable things; hope, kindness, and positivity. This journey has truly challenged me and helped me to grow. It was an amazing experience.
